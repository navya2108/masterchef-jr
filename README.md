INSTRUCTIONS

Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large mixing bowl, use a hand mixer to cream the butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add in buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract and beat until combined.
Add in flour, baking powder, and salt, and mix until just combined. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure everything gets mixed in.
Fill each cupcake liner half full. Bake at 350 for 14 to 18 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Remove cupcakes from pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting with your favorite frosting.
